MicroDRUM is the most economical and simple way to build MIDI drum trigger.<br>
It’s based on Arduino and can be used with a huge variety of e-pads / e-cymbals,
up to 48 inputs!<br>
The output can be sent to a PC and converted to drum sounds through VST like BFD,
Addictive Drums and Superior Drummer, etc. …
The accompanying software allows features not found in any similar solution: a
direct interface with VST (without USB-MIDI cable), record, playback of tablature
to practice on, etc. …<br>
This is a Open Hardware product made in Italy!<br><br>
